# [ES] Updated Documentation for Elasticsearch Features

Problem Statement
## TDD Success Criteria
**GIVEN** fresh v0.3.0 installation  
**WHEN** I follow README Elasticsearch setup steps  
**THEN** I can create data flows to Elasticsearch and search indexed data within 20 minutes

## Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-elasticsearch-documentation.sh
[ -f README.md ] && grep -q "Elasticsearch setup" README.md && \
grep -q "data indexing" README.md && \
grep -q "search operations" README.md && \
grep -q "CAI.*search for" README.md
echo $? # 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

## Implementation Requirements
- Update main README with Elasticsearch setup instructions
- Document data indexing pipeline creation process
- Add CAI search command examples and workflows
- Include Elasticsearch troubleshooting and performance tips
- Create user guide for search and analytics operations
- Document best practices for index management and data retention
