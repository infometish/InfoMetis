# [ES] Elasticsearch Health Monitoring and Logging

Objective
## Summary
Implement comprehensive health monitoring and logging capabilities for Elasticsearch service within the InfoMetis platform, ensuring operational visibility and troubleshooting support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Elasticsearch health check endpoints and monitoring scripts
- [ ] Implement logging configuration for Elasticsearch service operations
- [ ] Add cluster health status monitoring and alerting capabilities
- [ ] Create performance metrics collection for Elasticsearch operations
- [ ] Set up log rotation and retention policies for Elasticsearch logs
- [ ] Add monitoring integration with existing InfoMetis platform logging
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides and common issue resolution docs
- [ ] Implement automated health checks in deployment validation
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard or status display in console interface

## Implementation Details
- Create monitoring scripts in `v0.4.0/config/monitoring/`
- Configure Elasticsearch logging levels and output formats
- Set up health check endpoints for cluster and node status
