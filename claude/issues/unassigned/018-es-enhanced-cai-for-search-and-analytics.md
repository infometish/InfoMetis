# [ES] Enhanced CAI for Search and Analytics

Objective
## TDD Success Criteria
**GIVEN** data is indexed in Elasticsearch  
**WHEN** I run `./cai-pipeline.sh "search for data containing 'test'"`  
**THEN** CAI returns search results from Elasticsearch and shows query performance

## Test Script
```bash
#\!/bin/bash
# test-cai-search-analytics.sh
# First index some test data
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/elasticsearch/test-index/_doc -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "test data for search"}' >/dev/null 2>&1
sleep 2
./cai-pipeline.sh "search for data containing 'test'" 2>&1  < /dev/null |  grep -q "test data for search"
echo $? # 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

## Implementation Requirements
- Extend CAI commands to support Elasticsearch search operations
- Implement "search for" functionality with query parsing
- Add "show index" and "describe index" CAI commands
- Create analytics commands for data aggregation and statistics
- Implement query performance monitoring and reporting
