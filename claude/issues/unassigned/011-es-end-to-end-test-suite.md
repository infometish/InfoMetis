# [ES] End-to-End Test Suite

Objective
## Summary
Create comprehensive end-to-end test suite for v0.4.0 Elasticsearch integration, validating all components work together seamlessly and meet quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create automated deployment test for complete v0.4.0 stack
- [ ] Implement integration tests for NiFi-to-Elasticsearch data flow
- [ ] Add validation tests for Elasticsearch service accessibility and health
- [ ] Create console interface testing for all Elasticsearch management functions
- [ ] Implement data pipeline validation tests with sample data
- [ ] Add performance and load testing for Elasticsearch integration
- [ ] Create rollback and cleanup testing for failed deployments
- [ ] Implement cross-platform testing (Linux, WSL, container environments)
- [ ] Add documentation validation and user experience testing

## Implementation Details
- Create test suite in `v0.4.0/tests/` following InfoMetis testing patterns
- Implement both automated and manual testing procedures
- Create test data sets and validation criteria
- Set up continuous integration testing workflows
- Add performance benchmarking and regression testing

## Dependencies
- Requires ALL previous v0.4.0 Elasticsearch integration issues to be complete
- Uses existing InfoMetis testing infrastructure and patterns
- Requires complete v0.4.0 deployment stack for integration testing

## Definition of Done
- Complete test suite validates all v0.4.0 functionality
- Tests can be run automatically and provide clear pass/fail results
- Performance benchmarks establish baseline for future development
- Test documentation enables team members to run and maintain tests
- Test suite can detect regressions in future development cycles
