# [ES] NiFi-Elasticsearch Integration Processors

Objective
## Summary
Configure and validate NiFi processors for seamless integration with Elasticsearch, enabling data pipeline creation from NiFi to Elasticsearch indices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research and identify optimal NiFi processors for Elasticsearch integration
- [ ] Configure PutElasticsearchHttp or PutElasticsearchRecord processors
- [ ] Set up processor templates for common Elasticsearch operations (index, bulk operations)
- [ ] Configure connection pools and authentication for Elasticsearch access
- [ ] Create sample processor configurations for data transformation
- [ ] Test data flow from NiFi to Elasticsearch with sample data
- [ ] Document processor configuration patterns and best practices
- [ ] Create reusable processor group templates for common patterns

## Implementation Details
- Create processor configuration templates in `v0.4.0/config/nifi/`
- Configure Elasticsearch connection parameters for cluster access
- Set up data transformation templates for JSON document indexing
- Create validation processors for data quality checks
- Implement error handling and retry logic in processor configurations

## Dependencies
- Requires [ES] Elasticsearch Kubernetes Deployment Configuration (#63)
- Requires [ES] Elasticsearch Ingress and Service Setup (#64)
- Requires running NiFi instance (from v0.1.0 foundation)
- May require [ES] JavaScript Deployment Module (#65) for automated setup

## Definition of Done
- NiFi can successfully send data to Elasticsearch indices
- Processor configurations are tested and validated
- Templates are available for common data pipeline patterns
- Documentation covers processor setup and configuration
- End-to-end data flow validation completed
