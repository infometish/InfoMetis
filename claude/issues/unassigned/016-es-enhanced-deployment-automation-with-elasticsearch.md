# [ES] Enhanced Deployment Automation with Elasticsearch

Objective
## TDD Success Criteria
**GIVEN** fresh WSL environment  
**WHEN** I run `./deploy.sh`  
**THEN** script outputs "Elasticsearch available at: http://localhost:8080/elasticsearch" along with NiFi and Registry URLs

## Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-elasticsearch-deployment-automation.sh
./deploy.sh 2>&1  < /dev/null |  grep -q "NiFi available at: http://localhost:8080/nifi" && \
./deploy.sh 2>&1 | grep -q "Registry available at: http://localhost:8080/registry" && \
./deploy.sh 2>&1 | grep -q "Elasticsearch available at: http://localhost:8080/elasticsearch"
echo $? # 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

## Implementation Requirements
- Extend deployment script to include Elasticsearch deployment
- Add Elasticsearch to Traefik routing configuration  
- Implement Elasticsearch health checking and startup validation
- Configure Elasticsearch-NiFi integration during deployment
- Update deployment script to handle Elasticsearch dependencies and resource requirements
