# [ES] Elasticsearch-NiFi Integration

Objective
## TDD Success Criteria
**GIVEN** both NiFi and Elasticsearch are running  
**WHEN** I access NiFi UI Controller Services  
**THEN** NiFi shows Elasticsearch connection configured and can send test data

## Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-elasticsearch-nifi-integration.sh
# Check NiFi can connect to Elasticsearch
curl -s -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/nifi-api/controller-services  < /dev/null |  grep -q "elasticsearch" && \
curl -s http://localhost:8080/elasticsearch/_cluster/health | grep -q "yellow\|green"
echo $? # 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

## Implementation Requirements
- Configure Elasticsearch Controller Service in NiFi
- Set up authentication and connection parameters
- Create Elasticsearch index templates for data ingestion
- Configure NiFi processors for Elasticsearch operations (PutElasticsearch)
- Test data indexing and verify Elasticsearch document creation
