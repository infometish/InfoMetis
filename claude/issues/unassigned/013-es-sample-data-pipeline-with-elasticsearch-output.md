# [ES] Sample Data Pipeline with Elasticsearch Output

Objective
## Summary
Create a comprehensive sample data pipeline that demonstrates NiFi-to-Elasticsearch data flow capabilities, serving as both validation and example for users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design sample data pipeline that generates or ingests realistic data
- [ ] Configure data transformation processors for Elasticsearch document format
- [ ] Set up Elasticsearch index mapping for sample data structure
- [ ] Implement complete NiFi flow from data source to Elasticsearch index
- [ ] Add data validation and quality checks in the pipeline
- [ ] Create pipeline documentation with step-by-step setup instructions
- [ ] Test pipeline with various data volumes and formats
- [ ] Validate data appears correctly in Elasticsearch indices
- [ ] Create pipeline template for reuse and customization

## Implementation Details
- Create NiFi flow template in `v0.4.0/config/nifi/templates/`
- Design realistic sample data (e.g., log data, sensor data, or business events)
- Configure appropriate Elasticsearch index settings and mappings
- Include data transformation, validation, and error handling processors
- Add monitoring and alerting capabilities to the sample pipeline

## Dependencies
- Requires [ES] Elasticsearch Kubernetes Deployment Configuration (#63)
- Requires [ES] NiFi-Elasticsearch Integration Processors (#66)
- Requires running NiFi and Elasticsearch services
- May benefit from [ES] Console UI Integration (#67) for management

## Definition of Done
- Complete sample pipeline successfully processes data end-to-end
- Data appears in Elasticsearch with correct structure and indexing
- Pipeline template can be imported and customized by users
- Documentation enables users to understand and modify the pipeline
- Pipeline demonstrates best practices for NiFi-Elasticsearch integration
