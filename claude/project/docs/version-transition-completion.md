- Validated documentation consistency with v0.1.0 implementation experience
- Removed outdated kind-based deployment references

**Quality Improvements**:
- Documentation now matches actual implementation patterns
- Development procedures reflect production-validated approaches
- Clear migration path from legacy kind setup to k0s

### ✅ Step 4: Strategic Analysis and Operational Reporting
**Objective**: Generate comprehensive operational analysis and metrics

**Completed**:
- Created comprehensive operational analysis in `claude/project/docs/v0.1.0-operational-analysis.md`
- Documented development activity metrics and workflow effectiveness
- Analyzed component interaction patterns and architectural evolution
- Generated strategic insights for v0.2.0 planning

**Strategic Deliverables**:
- Complete development activity analysis (170+ workflow instances)
- Component modification frequency analysis
- Architecture evolution insights (kind→k0s transition)
- Process effectiveness documentation

### ✅ Step 5: User-Facing Reports and Knowledge Base Updates
**Objective**: Create user-facing documentation from operational insights

**Completed**:
- Generated executive summary in `docs/reports/v0.1.0-executive-summary.md`
- Created container+k8s integration patterns guide in `docs/knowledge-base/`
- Documented development best practices from v0.1.0 experience
- Established comprehensive knowledge base structure

**Knowledge Base Expansion**:
- Executive summary with business value analysis
- Technical integration patterns with validation evidence
- Development best practices derived from successful v0.1.0 execution
- Component interaction guides based on actual co-modification data

### ✅ Step 6: Get Started Documentation (Onboarding-Focused)
**Objective**: Create streamlined onboarding documentation for new team members

**Completed**:
- Created comprehensive quick-start guide in `docs/get-started/quick-start-guide.md`
- Documented 15-30 minute deployment procedures
- Included troubleshooting guides for common issues discovered in v0.1.0
- Established clear success criteria for new team member onboarding

**Onboarding Improvements**:
- 30-minute onboarding target with validation steps
- Practical troubleshooting based on actual development experience
- Clear prerequisites and system requirements
- Step-by-step deployment with validation checkpoints

## Knowledge Processing Results

### Development Pattern Recognition
**Validated Approaches**:
- Session-based development with clean boundaries
- Script-by-script testing for complex infrastructure
- Parallel documentation and implementation
- Container-first development patterns

### Component Interaction Analysis
**Key Relationships Identified**:
- Container caching ↔ Deployment automation (high correlation)
- k0s cluster ↔ Traefik ingress (tight integration requirement)
- NiFi deployment ↔ Storage configuration (configuration dependency)
- Documentation ↔ Implementation (parallel evolution pattern)

### Architecture Evolution Insights
**Major Transitions Documented**:
- Development platform: kind → k0s-in-docker
- Ingress controller: nginx → Traefik  
- Storage strategy: Fixed → Configurable (emptyDir ↔ PVC)
- Deployment approach: Manual → Systematic scripted automation
