# InfoMetis Development Best Practices

**Derived from**: v0.1.0 Development Experience  
**Last Updated**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: Production Validated

## Overview

This guide captures proven development patterns and practices discovered during InfoMetis v0.1.0 development. These practices have been validated through successful production deployment and enable reliable, efficient development workflows.

## Session-Based Development Pattern

### Clean Session Boundaries

**Principle**: Each development session has clear start/end boundaries with automatic work preservation.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Session start
start sesame  # Initializes clean development environment

# Session work
# ... development activities ...

# Session end  
finish sesame  # Preserves all work and archives session
```

**Benefits Realized**:
- Zero work loss across development sessions
- Clear development context switching
- Automated work preservation
- Clean audit trail of development activities

### Incremental Commit Strategy

**Pattern**: Regular small commits prevent work loss and enable safe experimentation.

**Validated Approach**:
```bash
# After each logical unit of work
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message of specific change"

# Benefits demonstrated:
# - Safe experimentation (easy rollback)
# - Clear development progression
# - Reduced integration conflicts
# - Detailed change history
```

**Commit Message Patterns** (From v0.1.0):
- `feat: add container image caching for offline deployment`
- `fix: update traefik ingress configuration for k0s compatibility`
- `docs: enhance environment setup with k0s-in-docker approach`

## Component-Driven Development

### Script-by-Script Testing Pattern

**Approach**: Systematic validation of each component before integration.

**Proven Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Implement individual script
./step-02-create-k0s-container.sh

# 2. Test script isolation
./test-cluster-setup.sh

# 3. Validate integration
./step-03-wait-for-k0s-api.sh

# 4. Test combined functionality
./test-nifi-deployment.sh
```

**Success Metrics** (v0.1.0 validated):
- Each script passes independent testing
- Integration testing validates component interactions
- No deployment failures due to untested components
- Clear error detection and recovery procedures

### Container-First Development

**Principle**: Design all components with container deployment as the primary target.

**Implementation Patterns**:
```yaml
# Development configuration (fast iteration)
volumes:
  - name: app-data
    emptyDir: {}

# Production configuration (persistence)
volumes:
  - name: app-data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: app-data-pvc
```

**Benefits Demonstrated**:
- Consistent behavior across development and production
- Easy environment switching (emptyDir ↔ PVC)
- Container-native application design
- Simplified deployment and scaling

## Documentation-Driven Development

### Parallel Documentation Pattern

**Approach**: Update documentation alongside implementation, not afterwards.

**Validated Workflow**:
1. **Design Phase**: Document intended approach in `docs/`
2. **Implementation Phase**: Update docs with actual implementation details
3. **Testing Phase**: Document testing procedures and results
4. **Release Phase**: Finalize documentation with lessons learned

**Example from v0.1.0**:
- `docs/environment-setup.md` updated with actual k0s-in-docker setup
- Container caching requirements documented alongside implementation
- Troubleshooting guides created during testing phases

### Living Documentation Principle

**Pattern**: Documentation reflects current reality, not outdated intentions.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# During development
# 1. Implement feature
# 2. Update relevant documentation immediately
# 3. Test both implementation and documentation
# 4. Commit implementation + documentation together
```

**Quality Indicators** (v0.1.0 validated):
- New team members can follow documentation successfully
- Documentation matches actual implementation
- No "documentation debt" accumulation
- Clear onboarding path for new contributors

## Infrastructure as Code Patterns

### Declarative Configuration Management

**Approach**: All infrastructure configuration defined in version-controlled files.

**File Organization** (Proven in v0.1.0):
```
v0.1.0/
├── manifests/           # Kubernetes YAML files
├── implementation/      # Deployment scripts
├── docs/               # Implementation documentation
└── cache/              # Container image cache
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Reproducible deployments across environments
- Version-controlled infrastructure changes
- Clear configuration evolution tracking
- Easy rollback and recovery procedures

### Environment Consistency Pattern

**Principle**: Identical deployment patterns across development, testing, and production.

**Implementation Strategy**:
```bash
# Same deployment scripts for all environments
./step-07-deploy-traefik.sh        # Works in dev, test, prod
./step-09-deploy-nifi.sh           # Identical across environments

# Environment-specific configuration through overlays
kubectl apply -f manifests/base/           # Base configuration
kubectl apply -f manifests/dev/            # Development overlays
kubectl apply -f manifests/prod/           # Production overlays
```

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### Systematic Testing Approach

**Pattern**: Test each component individually, then test integration.

**Test Hierarchy** (v0.1.0 validated):
```bash
# 1. Unit Tests (individual scripts)
./test-cluster-setup.sh
./test-traefik-ingress.sh
./test-nifi-deployment.sh

# 2. Integration Tests (component interactions)
./test-fresh-environment.sh
./test-cai-integration.sh

# 3. End-to-End Tests (complete workflows)
./test-complete-deployment.sh
```

**Quality Gates**:
- All unit tests must pass before integration
- Integration tests validate component interactions
- End-to-end tests confirm complete functionality
- No manual testing shortcuts

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Pattern**: Anticipate failures and provide clear recovery procedures.

**Implementation Examples**:
```bash
# Wait for service readiness with timeout
wait_for_nifi() {
    timeout=300
    while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
        if kubectl get pods -n infometis -l app=nifi | grep Running; then
            echo "NiFi is ready"
            return 0
        fi
        sleep 5
        timeout=$((timeout - 5))
    done
    echo "Timeout waiting for NiFi"
    return 1
}
```

**Recovery Procedures**:
- Clear error messages with suggested solutions
- Automated cleanup for failed deployments
- Rollback procedures for each deployment step
- Health check validation after each operation

## Performance and Optimization Patterns

### Resource-Aware Development

**Principle**: Design with resource constraints and optimization in mind.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
```yaml
# Resource limits based on actual usage (v0.1.0 testing)
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "2Gi"      # Minimum for NiFi startup
    cpu: "1000m"       # Single core sufficient for development
  limits:
    memory: "4Gi"      # Maximum to prevent OOM
    cpu: "2000m"       # Burst capacity for processing
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Container image size optimization (multi-stage builds)
- Startup time optimization (readiness/liveness probes)
- Resource sharing (development vs production profiles)
- Storage optimization (emptyDir vs PVC based on use case)

### Offline-First Design

**Pattern**: Design for air-gapped and low-connectivity environments.

**Implementation Strategy**:
```bash
# Container image caching (1.6GB total for v0.1.0)
./cache-images.sh

# Offline deployment validation
# 1. Deploy from cached images only
# 2. Test all functionality without internet
# 3. Validate image loading and service startup
# 4. Confirm complete platform functionality
```

## Workflow Automation Patterns

### Systematic Deployment Orchestration

**Pattern**: Break complex deployments into systematic, testable steps.

**Step-by-Step Approach** (v0.1.0 proven):
```bash
# Each step has single responsibility
step-02-create-k0s-container.sh    # Cluster creation only
step-03-wait-for-k0s-api.sh        # API readiness validation
step-04-configure-kubectl.sh       # Client configuration
step-05-create-namespace.sh        # Namespace setup
step-06-remove-master-taint.sh     # Cluster configuration
step-07-deploy-traefik.sh          # Ingress controller
step-09-deploy-nifi.sh             # Application deployment
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Clear failure isolation (know exactly what failed)
- Easy debugging (test individual components)
- Incremental deployment (can stop/resume at any step)
- Reproducible procedures (same steps every time)

### Automated Validation Integration

**Pattern**: Every deployment step includes automated validation.

**Validation Examples**:
```bash
# After k0s deployment
kubectl get nodes | grep Ready || exit 1

# After Traefik deployment
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=traefik --timeout=300s

# After NiFi deployment
curl -f http://localhost:8080/nifi/ || exit 1
```

## Cross-Repository Development

### Task Distribution Pattern

**Approach**: Clear communication patterns for cross-repository work coordination.

**Implementation** (from claude-swift integration):
```bash
# Create cross-repository task
task infometish/InfoMetis sesame

# Process received tasks
inbox sesame

# Distribute completed work
outbox sesame
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear coordination between related repositories
- Systematic task tracking and completion
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Audit trail of cross-repository activities
