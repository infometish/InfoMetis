# InfoMetis Deployment Strategy

## Multi-Environment Philosophy

InfoMetis operates on the principle that **core services should be identical across all environments**, with environmental differences handled exclusively at platform boundaries.

## Deployment Environment Types

### Development Environments

**Characteristics**:
- Rapid iteration and experimentation
- Minimal security and compliance overhead
- Easy setup and teardown
- Local development workflow support

**Primary Platform**: k0s-in-Docker (Production-Ready Development)
- Lightweight Kubernetes distribution optimized for edge/IoT
- Full production compatibility and feature parity
- Easy cleanup and management with docker container isolation
- Minimal host system impact with efficient resource usage

**Alternative Platform**: WSL with kind (Legacy Support)
- Native performance for Linux development
- Full Kubernetes feature set
- Production-equivalent deployment patterns

### Testing Environments (UAT)

**Characteristics**:
- Production-equivalent infrastructure
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Security and compliance validation
- Performance and scale testing

**Primary Platform**: k0s on dedicated infrastructure
- Lightweight Kubernetes with minimal overhead
- Production-ready deployment patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Security hardening appropriate for testing

### Production Environments

**Deployment Modes**: InfoMetis supports multiple production deployment approaches

**Independent Cluster Mode**:
- Full cluster control and configuration
- Optimal performance and resource utilization
- Complete security and networking control
- Ideal for dedicated InfoMetis deployments

**Shared Cluster Mode**:
- Integration with existing cluster infrastructure
- Respect for existing policies and constraints
- Self-contained operation within assigned boundaries
- Compatibility with organizational cluster standards

## Deployment Architecture

### Core Service Layer

**Environment-Agnostic Services**:
- All core InfoMetis services (NiFi, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Grafana)
- Service communication patterns and data flows
- Internal configuration and orchestration logic
- Business logic and processing capabilities

**Consistency Requirements**:
- Identical service definitions across environments
- Same internal communication patterns
- Consistent data processing behavior
- Uniform service APIs and interfaces

### Border Adaptation Layer

**Environment-Specific Components**:
- Ingress and egress routing (Traefik configuration)
- Security policies and authentication integration
- External system integration adapters
- Compliance and monitoring integration

**Adaptation Responsibilities**:
- External protocol handling and translation
- Environment-specific security enforcement
- Resource limits and scaling policies
- External service discovery and integration

### Template-Based Configuration

**Configuration Strategy**:
- Base templates for all service configurations
- Environment-specific overlays for border adaptation
- Automated template processing and validation
- Version-controlled configuration evolution

**Template Hierarchy**:
```
Base Service Templates (environment-agnostic)
  ↓
Environment Overlays (border-specific)
  ↓
Deployed Configuration (environment + base)
```

## Network Architecture

### Internal Networking

**Service Communication**:
- Clear text protocols over encrypted transport
- Standard Kubernetes service discovery
- Load balancing and routing through platform
- Minimal authentication barriers between internal services

**Security Model**:
- Network-level encryption for transport security
- Trust boundaries at processing unit borders
- Internal services operate with minimal security overhead
- Focus on functionality and performance internally

### External Networking

**Border Security**:
- All external traffic through Traefik ingress
- TLS termination and certificate management
- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Protocol translation and routing

**Integration Patterns**:
- Standard ingress patterns for external access
- Configurable authentication integration
- External system connection through border adapters
- Environment-specific external routing

## Deployment Workflows

### Development Workflow

**Local Development**:
1. Start k0s-in-Docker cluster with InfoMetis templates
2. Deploy core services through orchestration layer  
3. Configure development-specific border settings with Traefik ingress
4. Access services through local ingress patterns (localhost:80/443)

**Collaborative Development**:
- Shared development cluster with individual namespaces
- Common service templates with developer-specific configurations
- Integrated CI/CD for template and service validation

### Environment Promotion

**Promotion Strategy**:
1. **Template Validation**: Ensure templates work in target environment
2. **Border Configuration**: Update environment-specific border settings
3. **Service Deployment**: Deploy identical core services
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate external integrations in new environment
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm performance characteristics

**Consistency Verification**:
- Automated testing of service behavior across environments
- Configuration drift detection and correction
- Performance and functionality regression testing

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring and Observability

**Cross-Environment Monitoring**:
- Consistent monitoring patterns across all environments
- Environment-specific alerting and escalation
- Centralized logging with environment context
- Performance comparison across environments

**Border Monitoring**:
- External integration health and performance
- Security event monitoring and alerting
- Resource utilization and scaling metrics
- Environment-specific compliance monitoring

### Disaster Recovery

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Template-based rapid environment reconstruction
- Automated backup of configuration and data
- Cross-environment failover capabilities
- Consistent recovery procedures across environments

**Business Continuity**:
- Multi-environment deployment for high availability
- Automated failover between environments
- Data synchronization and consistency across environments

### Security Strategy

**Defense in Depth**:
- Network-level encryption for all communication
- Border security enforcement for external access
- Service-level authentication for sensitive operations
- Audit logging and compliance monitoring

**Threat Model**:
- External threat isolation at border layer
- Internal threat mitigation through monitoring
- Configuration tampering protection
- Service compromise containment

## Platform Benefits

### Development Velocity

**Rapid Environment Setup**:
- Minutes from template to running environment
- Consistent development experience across team
- Easy experiment and feature branch testing
- Automated environment lifecycle management

**Simplified Deployment**:
- Single template deployment across environments
- Automated environment-specific adaptation
- Reduced deployment complexity and errors
- Clear deployment success validation

### Operational Reliability

**Consistent Behavior**:
- Identical service behavior across environments
- Predictable performance and scaling characteristics
- Reduced environment-specific troubleshooting
- Clear escalation paths for environment issues

**Automated Operations**:
- Self-healing service recovery
- Automated scaling and resource management
- Configuration drift detection and correction
- Proactive monitoring and alerting
