# Orchestrator Environments

This directory contains environment-specific configurations and deployment templates for the InfoMetis Orchestrator.

## Directory Structure

```
environments/
├── docker-compose/     # Docker Compose stack definitions
├── kubernetes/         # Kubernetes deployment templates
└── standalone/         # Standalone deployment configurations
```

## Environment Types

### Docker Compose
- **Purpose**: Single-host multi-container deployments
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, small-scale production
- **Features**: Simple networking, volume management, service discovery

### Kubernetes
- **Purpose**: Container orchestration at scale
- **Use Case**: Production deployments, high availability, scaling
- **Features**: Load balancing, auto-scaling, rolling updates, health checks

### Standalone
- **Purpose**: Individual component deployments
- **Use Case**: Testing individual components, debugging, development
- **Features**: Isolated component testing, minimal dependencies

## Usage

The orchestrator automatically selects the appropriate environment based on:
1. Available container runtime (Docker vs Kubernetes)
2. Configuration settings
3. User preferences via CLI/API

Each environment provides the same component interfaces but with deployment-specific optimizations and configurations.
